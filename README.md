# Advanced-Computer-Vision
## Description
This repository contains 5 different subprojects, which are meant to solve different tasks in the wide domain of computer vision. The idea of those subprojects, was to implement 
different approaches to various tasks present in computer vision (e.g. classification, pose regression, image generation). Those approaches are as follows:
* Regression (Linear/Non-Linear/Dual-Model) and Classfication.
* Random Forests for Image Classification
* SVM for training a classifier based on HOG features
* (Convolutional) Neural Networks for CIFAR-10 images classification
* Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) for image generation

Project was made for the Computer Vision II SS23 module at the University of Bonn. 
## Installation
Python version 3.8 was used for this project, although versions >3.8 should be compatabile. \
To run a subproject, go into a proper folder and install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running projects
Structure of files differs from task to task, but generally running main.py or main.ipynb should do the trick.
